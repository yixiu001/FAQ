主题: Please recover my Telegram account
内容: 
Dear Telegram Support Team,I am writing to appeal the recent ban on my Telegram account. I understand that my account has been blocked for violating the terms of service, but I would like to explain the circumstances surrounding this situation.

I can assure you that my actions were not intentional and I did not have any malicious intent. I understand the importance of following the rules and regulations set by Telegram, and I regret any actions that may have led to my account being banned.

I would be grateful if you could consider lifting the ban on my account. I have a strong passion for using Telegram and I have used it for many years to communicate with friends and family. Losing access to my account would have a significant impact on my daily life.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my appeal. I look forward to hearing back from you and hopefully having my account reinstated.

My mobile number is xxxx

My Telegram account was banned a long time, i think Anti-Spam system triggered wrong action, its mistake that account was banned. Now i have again got access, but still I'm limited to anything. It's wrong & false triggered action i should say. 

I have been a loyal to Telegram & even contributed to better Telegram.

I am requesting for removal of account limitations.

提醒:
申诉后，官方会核查你的账户，并根据情况恢复你的账户，但不一定就能解封！
有人申诉后解封了，有人申诉了多次也未解封，不能一概而论！
